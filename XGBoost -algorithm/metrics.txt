R-squared: 0.89


1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE):
    - Linear Regression: 11193.55
    - XGBRegressor: 10581.3

lower --> better
XGBRegressor is better than Linear Regression
XGBRegressor predicts values closer to the actuals on average

2. Mean Squared Error (MSE):
    - Linear Regression: 226,453,280.28
    - XGBRegressor: 237,392,635.25

lower --> better
Linear Regression is better than XGBRegressor
even though LinReg is better this metric is squared and may not always provide the most intuitive measure of performance

3. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):
    - Linear Regression: 15048.36
    - XGBRegressor: 15407.55

lower --> better
Linear Regression is better than XGBRegressor

4. R-squared (RÂ²):
    - Linear Regression: 0.9
    - XGBRegressor: 0.89

closer to 1 --> better
Linear Regression is better than XGBRegressor

Overall, Linear Regression appears to perform slightly better based on MSE, RMSE, and R-squared.
